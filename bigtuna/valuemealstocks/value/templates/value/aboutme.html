													<p><span class="image left"><img src="{% static 'value/images/mihir.jpg' %}" alt="" /></span>Hello! My name is Mihir Mirchandani and I am the creator of this website. I made this during the summer of 2020 as a project entering my senior year of high school. Though small, this site has a lot of value. No pun intended. I am a future statistics major and a future MBA graduate in finance. I want to do financial analysis and maybe go into the fintech industry. My dream job would probably be a Chief Financial Officer.</p>

													<p>I actually have an interesting story of how I got all the way from playing with a couple cells on a spreadsheet to making an awesome website. I hope you enjoy it!</p>

													<p>Abruptly, in the middle of March, I was told to work remotely due to COVID-19. This was really scary as I did not want my junior year to be wasted. When I was bored, I collected data for new Covid Cases. The day I was let go from school, I worked on making a giant spreadsheet that would store data and make projections on an exponential best fit curve. At the time, there were only 200,000 cases and I say only because that is how much we move up by in a day now. </p>

													<p>I was really passionate about these sheets and I tried my best in predicting what the day after case count would be. After a while, it became really tedious inputting data into a spreadsheet from websites like Wikipedia and Worldometer. I wanted to make something that was autonomous and independent. A spreadsheet that would feed itself new data everyday. Wouldn’t that be cool? </p>

													<p>So I picked up a few programs on spreadsheets that would import data from other sites and put it in my own spreadsheet. After a couple tries, everything ran smoothly. I was super impressed with it and I wanted to go further. I tried importing data like the weather, the news, and even how stocks were doing. This came to the point that I had a spreadsheet that would tell me everything from case counts to how the Dow Jones was doing. At the time, markets were very unstable and the fear index, VIX, was skyrocketing. I was trying to track correlations between cases, fear indices, and stock prices and it looked like there was no immediate correlation. </p>


													<p>I wanted to learn more about stocks, so I went through a course on Udemy that taught me about Python and how powerful it is in terms of data sciences, statistics, and what I enjoyed looking at, stocks! </p>

													<p>As I got the hang of things, I made more and more sheets that would write data from Python to Excel and as I researched further and further, I came across the term intrinsic value. This value would determine a fair price at which the stock should be. I tried to search for such valuations, but no one had it for free. </p>


													<p>But that wouldn’t stop me. I had to find a way to get my hands on the intrinsic value and when I had that, I could be an expert at managing portfolios. It looked pretty complicated at first because there were so many valuation tools, but after a couple weeks of research, I had an idea of what data I was going to need and what type of calculations I had to do. After 4 exhausting weeks of python calculations, data analysis, and excel, I finally did it. I found something that no one had, the intrinsic value. </p>




													<p>I looked at the value and it actually seemed super small compared to the price. The purpose of such a value was to wait for an intersection such that I would buy the stock as it went under the value. However, looking at the data, it was almost impossible to see such a thing happen unless there were a couple company splits!</p>


													<p>Then, I came up with the idea of weightages, having different portions of data outweigh others in a way to come up with a more reasonable and approachable price. This was concluded as the weighted average in my data and it holds a majority of sales and earnings which I found to be the most integral part of valuing these stocks. </p>



													<p>Today, I have made a weighted fair value on things that matter, especially during the rough times that we are in. This assessment is pretty accurate and really nice to monitor. If prices fall, which is inevitable, it is worth monitoring my site for you to buy below the fair value. For the aggressive investors, I would recommend buying at the Margin of Safety as this would ensure high yields at a very undervalued price. It is also important to know when to sell as a stock is overvalued. That would be your judgement, but if the price is above the value, note that you don’t have to sell everything. In the end, value gives a better understanding of a reasonable price and where the current price should be with respect to that value.</p>

													<p>I try to make this website as accurate as possible. I hope it can help you in your investing needs. Happy investing!</p>
